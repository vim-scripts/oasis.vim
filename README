This file provides syntax definitions for OASIS-CC.

Note that this syntax file only fully defines the statements commonly used in configuring the OASIS-CC database (i.e. if blocks and insert/delete/update commands).  The full range of CSTOL commands have not been taken into consideration by this script.
